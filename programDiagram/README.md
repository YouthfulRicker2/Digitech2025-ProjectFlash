This is the program flowchart between stages of it's creation.

The core of the program is illustrated in the first flowchart created:
![initialCoreDiagram](1-Core/programCore.drawio.svg)
The program in this diagram simply takes the data from an external plot of data and shows it to the player, at which point when the player reads the card and posesses the ability to answer confidently, they press enter and view the answer. If their mental answer matches the card, they can say they got it correct. If not, then they say they didn't, and it automatically enters value 1.
